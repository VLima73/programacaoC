About Me
I’m José Valdir de Souza Lima, passionate about technology, education, and accessibility. I work as a Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) translator and interpreter at the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL), and I’m increasingly interested in developing digital solutions that promote inclusion and meaningful learning. I’m currently expanding my programming skills to create interactive and accessible educational projects.

Project Objective
This project was developed as part of my learning process in the C programming language. The goal is to build a simple and functional application that serves as a foundation for more advanced challenges in the future, especially those focused on education and digital accessibility. By programming in this procedural paradigm, I aim to understand system development from the ground up and apply this knowledge to both my teaching and technological practices.
